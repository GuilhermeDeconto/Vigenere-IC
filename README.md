# Vigen√®re Cryptanalysis

Project developed for the Systems Security discipline of the Software Engineering course at PUCRS in 2021/2.

This project aims to find a clear text from a ciphertext using the Index of Coincidence, chi-squared and OpenMP.

## OpenMP

OpenMP is a set of compiler directives as well as an API for programs written in C, C++ that provides support for parallel programming in a shared-memory environment.

When OpenMP encounters a directive such as `#pragma omp parallel for` it creates as many threads as available in the host system and simultaneously execute the parallel region.

## Prerequisites

- OpenMP
  - `brew install libomp`
- CMake

# Benchmark
